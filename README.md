# Adobe India Hackathon 2025 – Connecting the Dots

## Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge.

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

As part of Adobe's "Connecting the Dots" challenge, this project reimagines the PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience that understands structure, surfaces insights, and connects content like a true research companion.
